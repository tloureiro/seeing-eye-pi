###Easy to use
Just a keyboard and earphones are necessary to use it. 
Textual commands are designed to be simple and logical.
The target audience for seeing eye pi are people with little or no experience with computers.

###Easy to extend
Any simple program, in any language that can read from the keyboard and output text to terminal can be used. 
Seeing eye pi is in charge of providing the keyboard feedback and reading the output produced by the applications.

###Affordable
The ultimate goal of this project is to produce an affordable portable device (under 50 dollars) that is able to perform a variety of basic tasks like accessing online information, listening to audiobooks and writing e-mails.
